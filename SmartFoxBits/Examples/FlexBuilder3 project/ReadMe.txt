The SmartFoxBits Base Pack examples are provided as an Adobe Flex Builder 3 project archive file.
In order to install the project:
- open Flex Builder 3;
- choose the menu option: File->Import->Flex Project...;
- click on the Browse button near the "Archive file" input field;
- click on the Finish button.

NOTE: the examples project can't be imported in Flex Builder 2 even if compilation has been targeted to Flex 2.0.1 Hotfix 3 SDK.
Anyway, source files are quite simple and can be easily recreated in Flex Builder 2 by creating a new project, copying the asset files and copy/pasting the mxml/as source code.
